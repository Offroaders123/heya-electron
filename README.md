Looking into what is needed to make a modern Electron project nowadays.

I want to use Vite and TypeScript, and I don't like to use setups that abstract a bunch of configuration away from me. Maybe Vite could be considered as that, so maybe I'm speaking in terms out of my rear-end, lol. I'm trying to redo my newly acquired skepticism about Electron as well, because I want to start making more projects of mine accessible and more exemplary. I don't want to try being the most fine-tuned at things as much, if it's going to limit my experiences and demonstration of the things I've learned. I still want to keep that at heart for my own interests and project investments, but I don't want to keep that from limiting my learning and growth towards new ventures, and getting my name out there for getting into the programming circle. What are the best ways to make yourself marketable and represent the things you've learned?
